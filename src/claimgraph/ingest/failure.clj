  "Failure ingester: when agent or developer work is rejected or reverted,
  extract WHY — this is where procedural memory grows from (the largest
  cluster of measured wins at MemAgents 2026; review §3.4).

  Design guardrails straight from the literature: extract the LESSON, not
  the diff (ERL/Memory Transfer Learning — heuristics transfer, raw traces
  cause negative transfer), and preferentially capture lessons about
  MUTATING actions — writes, migrations, deploys, schema changes — where
  deviations kill outcomes (SABER). Lessons land as `core/failure-mode`
  facts (subject = the tool/namespace/action; object = the lesson literal),
  corrective practices as `prefers`, human rulings as `decided-against`.

  Same machinery as the session ingester: pluggable extractor, roster
  prior, 0.7 confidence cap, full conflict machinery, raw input kept as
  evidence. The episode is typed :failure-report — the valence signal the
  outcome-reinforcement work (roadmap #24) consumes."
