(ns claimgraph.ingest.code
  "Language-agnostic mechanical code ingester (docs/language-adapters.md):
  the driver behind `ingest-code` and the ambient code-freshness stage of
  `hooks run`.

  A registry of analyzer adapters — Clojure via edamame, Kotlin via an
  internal line parse, TypeScript/JavaScript by shelling to a pinned
  dependency-cruiser, plus anything a project adds under `code-analyzers`
  in .claimgraph/config.json — each produces the same tiny interchange
  format, one map per source unit (external commands emit it as JSONL or a
  JSON array):

      {\"unit\": \"shoply.auth\", \"file\": \"src/shoply/auth.clj\",
       \"requires\": [\"shoply.db\", \"external:react\"],
       \"language\": \"clojure\"}

  The interchange format is the only thing that crosses the analyzer
  boundary: everything past it — fact derivation, the reconciliation plan,
  the pass itself — is shared, pure where possible, and identical for every
  language. Facts, all :source-type :code / :epistemic :observation:

      <unit> core/defined-in <file>       (cardinality :one — file-grained
                                           units only, never package-grained)
      <file> core/written-in \"<language>\"
      <unit> core/depends-on <unit>       (scope \"external\" when external)

  Unprefixed `requires` resolve against the emitted unit set; anything
  unmatched is scoped \"external\" — a resolution miss can create an
  external-scoped fact, never a wrong local edge.

  Each pass reconciles against the previous one: code-sourced facts the new
  analysis no longer produces are invalidated mechanically (non-lossy).
  Reconciliation is language-guarded: an adapter that skipped (missing
  tooling) or failed never gets its facts invalidated by a pass that didn't
  look at its files — degraded, never wrong. Missing tooling degrades the
  adapter to :skipped with a hint; it never blocks the pass or the ambient
  loop."
