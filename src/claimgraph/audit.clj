(ns claimgraph.audit
  "`claim audit`: the memory-pile consistency scorecard (docs/memory-audit.md).
  Points the existing conflict machinery at the project's agent-memory pile
  (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, auto-memory notes, rules files) and reports what the
  markdown can't see about itself: contradictions, silent disagreements,
  staleness against the code, restatements, name drift, injection bloat.

  Top of the funnel, so the constraints are absolute: everything runs inside
  a throwaway in-memory store (store.memory/create + core/seed!), the real
  store is never opened, nothing is written (except the CLI's optional --out),
  and the only hard prerequisites are bb and an extractor command — not dtlv.

  Two deliberate deviations from the ambient notes tier (spec §5), both
  because this store never feeds durable memory: epistemic classes are KEPT
  at their predicate defaults (a reported decision ingests as a commitment so
  stance collisions flag instead of silently superseding), and code facts
  ingest FIRST so a pile claim colliding with the code flags against a
  code-sourced candidate — the staleness signal.

  Functional core / imperative shell like the notes ingester it adapts:
  prompt, clamping, finding classification, scorecard fold, and rendering are
  pure; the effects are the source scan, the pluggable extractor/judge
  shell-outs, and the in-memory store."
