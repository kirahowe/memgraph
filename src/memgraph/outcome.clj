(ns memgraph.outcome
  "The outcome signal (review §3.5): usefulness reaches the store without
  learned components. Read verbs append the fact ids they surfaced to a
  retrieval log next to the db — reads stay reads; the log defers the
  decision. When the work's outcome is known, `outcome accepted` reinforces
  every fact retrieved since the last mark (disuse clock reset, never a
  confidence raise — usefulness is evidence of aliveness, not of truth),
  and `outcome rejected` reinforces nothing and reports the facts that were
  in play, the review candidates. The rejection's LESSON arrives separately
  through ingest-failure (#15) — the two halves of the valence signal.

  The log is plain JSONL, capped, and entirely local; losing it costs
  nothing but reinforcement opportunities."
